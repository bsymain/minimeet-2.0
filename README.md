This is a Chrome extension that adds the following functionality, depending on the website that was visited:
1. Automatically login to a Google account when the browser navigates to accounts.google.com.
1. Automatically join the next Google Meet meeting when the browser navigates to meet.google.com.
1. Automatically join a Zoom meeting when the browser navigates to its web client link on zoom.us.

It is intended to be used on a headless device, to make the process of joining meetings hands-free.
